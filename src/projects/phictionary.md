description: A Phonetic Dictionary
---

The Phictionary is a phonetic dictionary for the english language. It has 3 main functions. One, it is a search engine for the different International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) characters that exist for the english language. Two, it is a transcriptor that can transcribe one word at a time from English into the corresponding IPA characters. Lastly, it can show you a random IPA character from the 34 that exist in the english language. This site was initially created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are plans to include more languages and features to the site.
