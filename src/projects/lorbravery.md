description: Random Deck Generator
---

LoR Bravery is a random deck generator for the card game Legends of Runeterra (LoR) that is inspired by Ultimate Bravery for League of Legends (LoL). The main functionality of this website is essentially randomly generating decks for each of the game modes that exist in LoR. You can then take those deck codes from the generated decks then use them in the actual game! This was created in Gatsby, but a lot of work went into randomly generating decks and that work was done in Javascript.
