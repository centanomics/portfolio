Just Plans is a simple volleyball positioning tracker. It's main function allows you to add player's full names to spots on a volleyball court, showing those players on the court with their initials. Once you have at least two players on the court, you can then press a rotate button to simulate the rotation that occurs in volleyball. As of now (and for my volleyball team's purpose), we are not considering actual volleyball positions (libero, middle blocket, etc.), though I do plan on adding this functionality eventually. This website was initially made within a week using mainly Gatsby and React.
